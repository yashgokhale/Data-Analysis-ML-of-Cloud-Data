# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms for Climate Modeling through Cloud Data
As a part of Gordon Group at CMU, my task involves developing machine learning algorithms to tune the hyperparameters in existing climate models to improve their efficacy.
A general workflow is:

This repository contains files used in its analysis and machine learning algorithm development. You can get back to me at ysg@andrew.cmu.edu for any further clarifications or suggestions.

Summary of files:
1. Aerosol_Data.ipynb: Data Analysis of Aersol Particle Parameters
2. Cloud_Droplet_Concentration.ipynb: Estimation of Cloud Doplet Concentration using Machine Learning Algorithms
3. Clustering_Mathews_Williams: Clustering of data for two datasets
4. Data_Collection_CDC: Exploratory Data Analysis and Cleaning for Collecting
5. KAZRARSCL_20110514: Analysis of KAZRARSCL Data
6. Williams Plots: Basic Analysis of Radar Data 
7. CDCCalculation_Analysis: Correlating Cloud Droplet Concentration through two correlations from the parameters obtained through Data_Collection_CDC.ipynb which is stored in CDC_calculations.csv
